## About have i been pawned
Here is the introduction fro Troy Hunt
 "I created HIBP as a free resource for anyone to quickly assess if they may
  have been put at risk due to an online account of theirs having been compromised
  or "pwned" in a data breach. I wanted to keep it dead simple to use and entirely 
  free so that it could be of maximum benefit to the community"
